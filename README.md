### Intent

I created this website to showcase the front-end development projects I have recently built. It includes some personal information about myself, skills, projects, a simple contact form and social media links.

### Built with

The project was built using the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- jQuery 3.5
- Flexbox

### What I Learnt

Throughout this project, I was able to enhance my skills and knowledge in various areas:

- Developed a responsive navbar for desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
- Added a favicon to the website.
- Utilized semantic HTML to structure the website.
- Implemented flexbox to create project cards with links to both GitHub and live sites.
- Created a simple contact form using flexbox.
- Designed a footer with navigation links to other pages.
- Utilized media queries for responsive design.
- Created a smooth scrolling effect for browsers that do not support the scroll-behavior property.

### Status

Project is: _in progress_

This website is still being developed and there will be updates to the design, projects and responsiveness.
