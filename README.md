### Intent

I created this website to showcase the frontend development projects I have recently built. It includes some personal information about myself, skills, projects, a simple contact form and social media links.

### Built with

The project was built using the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap v5.3
- Flexbox

### What I Learnt

Throughout the course of this project, I was able to improve my skills and expertise in a variety of areas:

- **Advanced Bootstrap Usage:** Leveraged [Bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) extensively to create a visually appealing and responsive design. Utilised Bootstrap components like cards for a polished user interface.

- **Custom CSS Styling:** Enhanced Bootstrap's default styles with custom CSS to give the website a unique and personalised look. This involved customizing colors, fonts, and spacing to align with the project's branding.

- **Responsive Web Design:** Ensured that the website looks and functions seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes. Implemented Bootstrap's responsive grid system and breakpoints for a mobile-friendly user experience.

- **Git Version Control:** Managed the project's source code effectively using Git, allowing for collaboration and version tracking.

- **Web Performance Optimisation:** Explored techniques to optimise website performance, including image optimisation, lazy loading, and minification of assets, to ensure fast load times and a better user experience.

- **Responsive Navigation:** Developed a responsive navigation bar that seamlessly adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Employed Bootstrap's responsive navigation components and customized their behavior to enhance user experience on various screen sizes.

- **Favicon Implementation:** Added a favicon to the website, contributing to its professional appearance and brand identity. Learned the importance of this small yet impactful detail in web design.

- **Semantic HTML Structure:** Utilized semantic HTML elements to structure the website's content, enhancing both accessibility and search engine optimisation. Employed tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` to provide a clear and meaningful document structure.

- **Flexbox Layout:** Implemented Flexbox to create visually appealing project cards. These cards include links to both GitHub repositories and live project sites, making it easier for users to explore my work. This approach provided precise control over the layout and alignment of card elements.

- **Footer Navigation:** Crafted a footer section with navigation links to other sections, ensuring easy navigation and accessibility. Leveraged semantic HTML and CSS to create an organised and visually appealing footer.

- **Media Queries for Responsiveness:** Employed media queries to implement responsive design principles effectively. This technique ensures that the website's layout and content adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations.

- **Smooth Scrolling Enhancement:** Created a smooth scrolling effect to enhance user experience for browsers that do not support the `scroll-behavior` property. This feature provides a consistent and pleasing scrolling experience for all users.

By working on this project, I not only improved my technical skills but also gained insights into the importance of user-centered design, performance optimisation, and accessibility, making me a more well-rounded frontend developer.

### Status

Project is: _in progress_

This website is still being developed and there will be updates to the design, projects and responsiveness.
