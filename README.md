# Max Lockwood Portfolio

I created this website to showcase the front-end development projects I have recently built. It includes some personal information about myself, skills, projects, a simple contact form and social media links.

## Technologies

Project is created with:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* jQuery 3.5

## What I Learnt

* How to build a responsive navbar for desktop, tablet and mobile.
* How to add a favicon to my site.
* How to use semantic HTML to section the static website. 
* I learnt how to use flexbox to create project cards with links to both GitHub and live sites.
* How to make a simple contact form using flexbox.
* Make a footer with navigation page links.
* Use media queries for responsive design.
* How to create a smooth scrolling effect for browsers that do not support the scroll-behaviour property.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_

This website is still being developed and there will be updates to the design, projects and responsiveness.
